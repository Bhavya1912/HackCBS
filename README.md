## Apne doctor
Apne Doctor is an Appointment Scheduling Website that enhance the utilization of expensive staff and facilities’ medical resources while reducing patient wait times. Appointment scheduling aims to build an appointment system that optimizes a specific quality standard in a healthcare application of scheduling tasks under uncertainty. The primary function of healthcare management programs is to minimize patient waiting times in public hospitals and increase patient satisfaction. Healthcare services coping with a large number of outpatients may have several obstacles to address. For instance, a long waiting period for a treatment negatively impacts the patient’s experience and may diminish the quality of care . In general, healthcare centers such as hospitals and clinics accumulate an increasing number of patients needing their services. Hospitals have to implement quick and effective healthcare facilities to accommodate new patients and keep people patronizing them . They must successfully identify the bottlenecks, anticipate the effect of diversity on-demand, and compute the optimal capacity distribution . Healthcare centers are evaluated by recognizing the best methods, applying measurable techniques, and having an obligation to improve.



In principle, the purposes of ASPs can be divided into four categories: decreasing service costs, increasing patient satisfaction, reducing waiting time, improving fairness, and reducing costs in healthcare [9]. One of the central issues in healthcare is fairness, which is a primary concern when scheduling patients and doctors [10]. Aside from fairness in scheduling, further encouragement is attained through a novel gain framework unique to the division and was not reported previously. Another critical issue on fairness is mending personal scheduling preferences [11]. The appointment scheduling’s main problem is optimizing healthcare resources by improving human resources and medical equipment utilization, leading to the depreciation of the patient waiting times.

### Built With



* [![Next][Next.js]][Next-url]
* [![React][React.js]][React-url]
* [![Bootstrap][Bootstrap.com]][Bootstrap-url]
* Stripe For Payment Gatway
* Sanity For Database


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started With Deployment

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
